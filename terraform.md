terraform init:
This command initializes a working directory containing Terraform configuration files. Its primary purposes are:

1. Download Provider Plugins: It downloads and installs the necessary provider plugins (e.g., AWS, Azure, GCP) that Terraform uses to interact with your infrastructure.

2. Initialize Modules: It downloads and configures any external modules referenced in your configuration. 

3. Configure Backends: It sets up the backend for storing your Terraform state file, which tracks the current state of your infrastructure.

terraform plan:
This command creates an execution plan, which is a detailed preview of the changes Terraform proposes to make to your infrastructure to achieve the desired state defined in your configuration files.

terraform apply:
This command executes the actions proposed in the execution plan generated by terraform plan. It applies the changes to your infrastructure, creating, modifying, or destroying resources as necessary to bring your infrastructure into alignment with the desired state defined in your Terraform configuration files.
